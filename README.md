I did this code to help a 4th grader practice the spelling challenge.

Here the list of words is in **spanish**.

The script can take several parameters as input:
- random: if used, then any words can be asked. Otherwise, the script will focus on past mistakes.
- num: the number of words played in the session
- len: the length of the words. If not specified, any kind of length can be asked.
If specified, only the words of that length will be asked. It's a fun way to learn!

The game will say the words out loud thanks to the gtts library.
